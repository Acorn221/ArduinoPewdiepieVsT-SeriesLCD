# ArduinoPewdiepieVsT-SeriesLCD
this uses a I2C LCD with an ESP8266
This is a quick little project I did a while ago for the pewdiepie Vs T-Series subscriber battle

Since I couldn't get HTTPS working with the ESP8266 (yet), I just used a HTTP web proxy which works well, some extra setup is needed though
